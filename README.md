# My Portfolio Website

This project was created using React.

## Purpose

I was dissatisfied with offerings that premade websites like SquareSpace offered. I wanted a way to show specific items based on either programming or game design and I wanted to be able to dynamically change that to my needs. I decided to use React to learn a new stack, to achieve my desired function, and get some good web exerience. This website is still very much a work in progress but I'm pleased with the current progress.
